on the six days of FreeCodeCamp learning HTML and CSS 

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - https://personal-portfolio-1-0.netlify.app/

## Features
actually great vertical phone use but a little bit bad on horizontal but still good enough.
teleport option.
website link (does not send you to my actual project as this was done in freecodecamp before everything was uploaded to github)
a little name of me on the bottom and sizing adjustment to some part;



## Built With
HTML - this one was made one some of the code i learned so far but it was basic with the only special part was the circle profile, fix position stuff, and more gap which not much but yah.
CSS - this could be the 2nd worst on css as everything look ok but not very appealing with the picture being pixelated and color not great.


## Attempt
time = aproximently 6 hour~.
ideas = this one was the one of the least planned on with the only part that was plan when making was the personal picture part

##Extra Comment By Me
This is not my actual porfolio. If i have to say the cirle profile picture was so hard to make because of trying to put it center and shrink when pages shrink, but atleast it somehow work out, i was still horrible with margin and padding also div as my understanding of it was still downloading in my brain.
